care_home_world_simple_cleaning_fails.py - Two cleaning agents, spills don't get removed and agents notify of fact, cleaning is default assignment of cleaning agents so they don't explicitly accept
care_home_world_simple_cleaning_works.py - Two cleaning agents, spills get removed when cleaning takes place, cleaning is default assignment of cleaning agents so they don't explicitly accept
care_home_world_mixed_locations.py - Two cleaning agents and two potential locaitons for spills.  The nearest agent moves towards and cleans the spill while the other agent - when generating tasks - reasons that it doesn't need to take action.
care_home_world_dgc.py - Two cleaning agents and two potential locaitons for spills.  The nearest agent moves towards and cleans the spill while the other agent - when generating tasks - reasons that it doesn't need to take action.  However the nearest agent breaks down, and informs everyone it no longer has dgc and does not accept the assignment.  As a result the other agent cleans the spill.


DESIGNING WORLD WITH HIERARCHY

1.  simple agents clean nearest spill by default
2.  however healt and safety agent delegates task to further agent
3.  as a result nearest agent doesn't bother (or further agent refuses and nearest agent does it anyway)
4.  Will add some stuff about failing to clean in time but carrying on anyway

DESIGNING MORE COMPLEX WORLD - SEARCH AND RESCUE

1.  We have search robots, lifting robots, transport robots and a coordinator that is not always in range.
2.  Design some kind of grid world with random - nothing, rubble, people, people and rubble in each location as well as range effects.
